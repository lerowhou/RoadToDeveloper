# Binary search

It is the very first algo that uses divide & conquer principle. The goal of this algorithm is simple it looks for middle element and compares it with element we're looking for (E).
If it smaller than E from this point algorithm movet to right side of the array if not - it goes to left side and so on. The last iteration will have middle element which equeals E.

**Complexity:**
